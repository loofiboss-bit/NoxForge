# NoxForge True Obsidian OLED Parity & Dual-Stack Architecture

NoxForge is an original MIT-licensed Plasma visual system: quiet graphite
surfaces, exact electric-lime state markers, restrained detail, and a compact
Forge Notch. Version 13.0.0 targets Fedora 44 and Arch Plasma/KWin 6.7+ with
Qt 6.11 on Wayland. It brings the Obsidian OLED palette to a dedicated Plasma
Style and Global Theme, Aurorae decoration, and the adaptive native Qt style.
The ecosystem also includes GTK 3/4, KDE syntax, VS Code/Cursor, Neovim,
Helix, Ghostty, Alacritty, Kitty, and Foot themes. Doctor schema 6 reports
components and palette synchronization in read-only mode. See the [v13
qualification status](docs/evidence/v13/automated-gate.md); physical and Arch
runtime checks remain pending.

Capture provenance and dimensions are recorded
in [media/manifest.json](media/manifest.json).

## Choose an installation

| Journey | What it includes | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Store/component | Independently selectable KDE packages, including Graphite and Obsidian variants | User-local; no native Qt style, login-manager integration, or root |
| Portable | All user-local components, Breeze controls, installer, uninstaller, doctor | No login-manager integration, native plugin, or active-settings write |
| Complete system | Portable content plus adaptive native Qt style and system doctor | PLM wallpaper asset on Fedora; Graphite and Obsidian SDDM themes remain selectable |

Start with [Quick start](docs/QUICKSTART.md), or read the dedicated
[portable](docs/INSTALL_PORTABLE.md), [Fedora](docs/INSTALL_FEDORA.md), and
[Arch](docs/INSTALL_ARCH.md) guides. Package installation never applies a
theme, resets a panel, edits KDE configuration, or restarts Plasma.

Fedora 44 uses Plasma Login Manager (PLM) by default. NoxForge Quiet is the
recommended PLM wallpaper; NoxForge does not ship or claim a custom PLM QML
greeter and never writes the active PLM configuration. Graphite and Obsidian
SDDM themes are optional compatibility components and are never selected
automatically.

These images carry explicit capture provenance in the media manifest. They are not a substitute for pending physical input,
cursor, audio, PAM/login, power, and live-session gates.

## Components

- Graphite and Obsidian Global Themes, Plasma Styles, and Aurorae decorations
  with KDE-correct package roots;
- NoxForge Dark and Obsidian colors, matching Konsole themes, Aurorae decoration,
  KWin switcher, icons, cursors, and sounds;
- GTK 3 and GTK 4 themes, Kate/KWrite syntax themes, and VS Code/Cursor editor
  themes in standard and Obsidian palettes;
- Ghostty, Alacritty, Kitty, and Foot configurations for both terminal palettes;
- five selectable wallpapers: **NoxForge Forge** (`NoxForge`), **NoxForge
  Quiet** (`NoxForge-Quiet`), **NoxForge Ultrawide** (`NoxForge-Ultrawide`),
  **NoxForge Obsidian** (`NoxForge-Obsidian`), and **NoxForge Obsidian
  Ultrawide** (`NoxForge-Obsidian-Ultrawide`);
- a native Qt 6 style that adapts to the active NoxForge palette, PLM wallpaper
  asset, and optional Graphite and Obsidian SDDM themes in the complete system
  edition;
- Neovim and Helix themes in both palettes;
- read-only edition-aware diagnostics, palette synchronization reporting, and
  deterministic checksums.

Store descriptions state that components install separately and that the Global
Theme archive is not a complete one-click transaction. Store and portable
defaults use `widgetStyle=Breeze`; system packages use `widgetStyle=NoxForge`.

## Compatibility and rollback

See [compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md), [troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md),
and the [doctor manual](docs/DOCTOR_MANUAL.md). Always select a known-good
theme and login surface before rollback. Portable removal is file-precise and
RPM/Arch removal touches only package-owned paths.

## Development and evidence

The v13 release scope is recorded in
[NOXFORGE_V13_PLAN.md](docs/NOXFORGE_V13_PLAN.md), indexed by
[IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). Run the release gate with:

```bash
mkdir -p build/baseline-source
baseline_commit=$(python3 -c 'import json; from pathlib import Path; print(json.loads(Path("distribution/release-manifest.json").read_text())["release"]["baseline"]["commit"])')
git archive "$baseline_commit" | tar -x -C build/baseline-source
python3 scripts/release-check.py --baseline-source build/baseline-source --skip-rpm
python3 scripts/build.py --mode all --skip-tests
```

Full matrices remain temporary CI evidence; compact manifests and curated
representatives are tracked. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) for boundaries.
